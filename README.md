# Using-Machine-Learning-to-Predict-Alzheimer-s-Disease

Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that leads to memory loss, poor judgment, confusion, and fear. It is the leading cause of dementia, a terminal disease affecting about 11% of Americans 65 years and older. Once a patient develops the disease, there is no repairing the damage done. There are currently no early screening systems in place to detect the development of Alzheimer’s. Machine learning techniques can be used to classify brain scans according to their level of dementia. In order to make predictions, we are using the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset. In this project we use K-Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble Methods, Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Class Activation Mapping to predict if a brain scan image will later develop the disease. Our main goal is to achieve the highest possible prediction accuracy. In the future, this methodology could be used in tandem with medical professional expertise for early intervention, research advancement, and clinical trial selection. Our best model achieved an accuracy of 98.07%.
